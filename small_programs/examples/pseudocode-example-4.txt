Problem:

Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns
a new array with every other element.

Pseudocode:

START

Given an array of integers:

1. SET local variable called 'arrayParam' to the array of integers.
2. SET local variable called 'i' to 0.
3. SET local variable called 'accumulator' to an empty array.
4. WHILE i < length of arrayParam:
  1. If the ith element of the arrayParam is even
    push the element to accumulator.
  2. iterator += 1
5. PRINT accumulator.

END
