Problem:

We need to ask the user to enter n collections of numbers, and
we want to find and display the largest number for each collection.

Test Cases (skip for now):

High-Level Pseudocode:

while the user wants to keep going
  - ask the user for a collection of numbers
  - extract the largest one from that collection and save it
  - ask the user if they want to input another collection

return the saved list of numbers

Quasi-Formal Pseudocode:

START

1. SET largeNumbers = []
2. SET keepGoing = true
3. WHILE keepGoing == true
  1. GET "enter a collection"
  2. SET collection to user input
  3. SET largestNumber = SUBPROCESS "extract the largest one from that collection"
  4. largeNumbers.push(largestNumber)
  5. GET "enter another collection?"
  6. IF "yes"
    keepGoing = true
  7. ELSE
    keepGoing = false
4. PRINT largeNumbers

END
