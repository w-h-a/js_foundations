Given a collection of numbers.

Iterate through the collection one by one.
  - save the first value as the starting value.
  - for each iteration, compare the saved value with the current value.
  - if the current number is greater
    - reassign the saved value as the current value
  - otherwise, if the current value smaller or equal
    - move to the next value in the collection

After iterating through the collection, return the saved value.

Given a collection of integers called "numbers"

1. SET iterator = 1
2. SET savedNumber = value within numbers collection at space 1
3. WHILE iterator <= length of numbers
    1. SET currentNumber = value within numbers collection at space "iterator"
    2. IF currentNumber > savedNumber
        savedNumber = currentNumber
    3. ELSE
        skip to the next iteration
    4. iterator = iterator + 1
4. PRINT savedNumber

END
