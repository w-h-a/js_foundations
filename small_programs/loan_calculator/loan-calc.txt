Problem:

First, you need to gather three pieces of information from a user:
1. the loan amount
2. the annual interest rate as either a percent or floating-point
3. the loan term in either years or months

Second, from those inputs, you need to calculate:
1. monthly interest rate
2. the loan term in months
3. (and eventually) the monthly payments (as a dollar and cents amount)

loAmount = loan amount
anIR = annual interest rate
moIR = monthly interest rate or anIR / 12
termYr = loan term in years
termMo = loan term in months or termYr * 12
moPayment = monthly payment



Pseudocode:

START

1.  GET loan amount from user.
2.  IF user input is permissible
      SET loAmount to user input.
    ELSE
      WHILE user input is impermissible
        Go back to step 1.
3.  GET answer to 'Is the interest rate in years or months?'
4.  IF user input is permissible and 'y'
      SET isInterestYears to true
    ELSE IF user input is permissible and 'm'
      SET isInterestYears to false
    ELSE
      WHILE user input is impermissible
        Go back to step 3.
5.  GET interest rate from user
6.  IF user input is permissible and isInterestYears === true
      SET anIR to user input and moIR = anIR / 12
    ELSE IF user input is permissible and isInterestYears === false
      SET moIR to user input
    ELSE
      WHILE user input is impermissible
        Go back to step 5.
7.  GET answer to 'Is the loan term in years or months?'
8.  IF user input is permissible and 'y'
      SET isTermYears to true
    ELSE IF user input is permissible and 'm'
      SET isTermYears to false
    ELSE
      WHILE user input is impermissible
        Go back to step 7.
9.  GET loan term from user
10.  IF user input is permissible and isTermYears === true
      SET termYr to user input and termMo = termYr * 12
    ELSE IF user input is permissible and isTermYears === false
      SET termMo to user input
    ELSE
      WHILE user input is impermissible
        Go back to step 9.
11. GET moPayment.
12. PRINT moPayment in dollars and cents.

END



Test Cases (for steps 1 and 2 above):

Input: 10000, 10,000, 10 000, all those with $ appended to front, or all those
as floating-point numbers.
Output: loAmount = 10000 or 10000.00

Input: NaN or less than or equal to 0
Output: ask user to try again



Test Cases (for steps 3 and 4 above):

Input: 'y' or 'Y'
Output: isInterestYears = true

Input: 'm' or 'M'
Output: isInterestYears = false

Input: anything other than those
Output: ask user to try again



Test Cases (for steps 5 and 6 above):

Input: 'y' or Y' (from previous) and 10 or 10.00 or 10%
Output: anIR = 0.10 and moIR = anIR / 12

Input: 'm' or 'M' (from previous) an 10 or 10.00 or 10%
Output: moIR to user input

Input: 0
Output: anIR = moIR = 0.00

Input: NaN, empty string, or negative number
Output: ask user to try again



Test Cases (for steps 7 and 8 above):

Input: 'y' or 'Y'
Output: isTermYears = true

Input: 'm' or 'M'
Output: isTermYears = false

Input: anything other than those
Output: ask user to try again



Test Cases (for steps 9 and 10 above):

Input: 'y' or 'Y' (from previous) and 10
Output: termYr to user input and termMo = termYr * 12

Input: 'm' or 'M' (from previous) and 10
Output: termMo to user input

Input: NaN or less than or equal to 0
Output: ask user to try again
