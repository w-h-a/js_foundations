Problem:

Ask the user if they'd like to choose english or french.
Ask the user for two numbers.
Ask the user for the type of operation to perform: add, subtract, multiply or divide.
Perform the calculation and display the result.
Ask the user if they would like to perform another calculation and
start a new calculation if, and only if, they respond in the affirmative.

Test Cases (for step 2 below):

Input: 'en' or 'fr' at 1
Output: goes to step 3

Input: anything other than 'en' or 'fr'
Output: keeps asking to try again

Test Cases (for step 10 below):

Input: 'y' or 'Y' or 'o' or 'O' (depending on language selection)
Output: goes back to step 3

Input: anything other than 'y' or 'Y' (if selected 'en') or 'o' or 'O' (if selected 'fr')
Output: exits
