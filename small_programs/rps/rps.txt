Problem:

Best of 5 Keep score of the player's and computer's wins.
When either the player or computer reaches five wins,
the match is over, and the winning player becomes the grand winner.
Don't add your incrementing logic to displayResults.
Keep your functions simple; they should perform one logical task â€” no more, no less.

I've also added a "watch-only" mode.

Pseudocode:

START

1.  GET user's preference for game-play or watch-play
2.  IF game-play
      GO to step 3
    ELSE watch-play
      GO to step 7
3.  GET user's preference for best of.
4.  IF user's selection is permissible
      SET rounds variable to user choice
    ELSE
      WHILE impermissible input
        GO back to step 1
5.  WHILE neither player has won Math.ceil(round / 2)
      1.  GET user's move
      2.  IF user's selection is permissible
            SET choice to user's move
          ELSE
            WHILE impermissible input
              GO back to step 3.1.
      3.  GET computer's move
      4.  PRINT choices
      5.  PRINT winner
      6.  SET number of wins
6.  PRINT grand winner
7.  GET computers' strategies
8.  PRINT torus of computers, identified by their strategies
9.  WHILE user wishes to watch
      1. SET scores and update probabilities to 0
      2. SET computers that are in play
      3. SET scores
      4. SET update prob distribution over strategies for focal computer
      5. SET strategy of focal computer
      6. PRINT torus of computers, identified by their strategies
