PROBLEM:

Given a string, write a changeMe function which returns the same
string but with all the words in it that are palindromes uppercased.

input: string
output: string

rules:
- explicit requirements:
  - every palindrome in the string must be converted to uppercase
  - palindromes are case sensitive ("Dad" is not a palindrome)
- implicit requirements:
  - if the string is an empty string, the result should be an empty string
  - if a word is already capped but not a palindrome, leave it alone.

TEST CASES (GIVEN):

changeMe("We will meet at noon") === "We will meet at NOON";
changeMe("No palindromes here") === "No palindromes here";
changeMe("") === "";
changeMe("I LOVE my mom and dad equally") === "I LOVE my MOM and DAD equally";
