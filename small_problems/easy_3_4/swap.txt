Problem:

Given a string of words, write a function that
swaps the first and last letters of every word.

You may assume that every word contains at least one letter and
that the string will always contain at least one word.
You may also assume that each string contains nothing but words and spaces and
no leading, trailing, or repeated spaces.

Test Cases (given):

swap('Oh what a wonderful day it is');  // "hO thaw a londerfuw yad ti si"
swap('Abcde');                          // "ebcdA"
swap('a');                              // "a"

Pseudocode:

START

1.  GET arrayOfWords
2.  WHILE arrayOfWords still has elements
      GET newArray with elements that swap the first and last letter of element
3.  RETURN joined newArray

END
