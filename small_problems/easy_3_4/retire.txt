Problem:

Build a program that logs the year that the user will retire
and how many more years the user has to work until retirement.
The program should take as input the user's current age
and the age they'd like to be when they retire.

Pseudocode:

START

1.  GET user's age
2.  GET user's age of retirement
3.  GET current year
4.  SET difference to user's age of retirement minus user's age.
5.  PRINT year that the user will retire (current year plus difference)
6.  PRINT how many more years of work (difference)

END
