Problem:

Program gets 6 numbers from user
logs a message that describes whether the 6th number is among the first 5

Pseudocode:

START

1.  SET n to length of initial numbers
2.  GET user numbers
3.  GET the number that the user wishes to search for
4.  IF the search number is included in the initial n numbers
      PRINT 'The number appears in first n numbers'
    ELSE
      PRINT 'The number does not appear in the first n numbers'

END
