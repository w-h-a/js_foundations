Problem:

Write a function that takes a string consisting of zero or more words and
returns an object that shows,
for each word size n that actually occurs in the input string,
the count (or frequency) of words with word size n.

Words consist of any sequence of non-space characters.

Your wordSizes function should exclude non-letters
when determining the size of words.
For instance, the word size of 'it's' is 3, not 4.

Test Cases (Given):

wordSizes('Four score and seven.');                       // { "3": 1, "4": 1, "5": 2 }
wordSizes('Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle!');  // { "3": 5, "6": 3 }
wordSizes("What's up, doc?");                              // { "2": 1, "3": 1, "5": 1 }
wordSizes('');                                            // {}

Pseudocode:

START

1.  GET clean version of string (only alphabet and spaces allowed)
2.  GET arrayOfWords
3.  WHILE arrayOfWords still has elements
      GET size of the word
      SET frequency table to plus one for that size
4.  RETURN frequency table

END
