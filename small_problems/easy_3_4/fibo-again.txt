Problem:

The Fibonacci series is a series of numbers 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
such that the first two numbers are 1 by definition, and
each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous numbers.Â 

Write a function that calculates and returns
the index (in the series) of the first Fibonacci number that
has the number of digits specified by the argument fed into the function.
Assume the first Fibonacci number has an index of 1.
That is, assume the first Fibonacci number is 1 rather than start with
the zeroth Fibonacci number (which is 0).

Test Cases (given):

findFibonacciIndexByLength(2);       // 7
findFibonacciIndexByLength(10);      // 45
findFibonacciIndexByLength(16);      // 74

// Don't try any higher values until you read the solution Discussion

Pseudocode:

START

1.  SET fib idx to 1
2.  SET fib number to 1
3.  SET fib length to stringified fib length
4.  WHILE it is not true that input and stringified fib length are identical
      SET fib number = fib(fib idx)
      SET fib length
      SET fib idx to fix idx plus 1
5.  RETURN fib idx - 1

END
