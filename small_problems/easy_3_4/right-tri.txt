Problem:

Function should take positive integer, n.
Function should log a right triangle whose sides each have n stars (*).
The hypotenuse endpoints should be lower-left and upper-right.
The right-angle should be lower-right.
The triangle should be filled in with the stars (*).

Test Cases (given):

triangle(5);

    *
   **
  ***
 ****

triangle(9);

Pseudocode:

START

1.  GET n from user
2.  WHILE n is impermissible
      GO back to step 1
3.  SET spaceNum to n
4.  SET starNum to 0
5.  WHILE spaceNum >= 0
      PRINT repeated spaces for spaceNum and repeated stars for starNum
      spaceNum -= 1
      starNum += 1

END
