Problem:

Write a function that determines the mean of the three scores passed to it,
and return the letter associated with that grade.

Numerical score letter grade list:

90 <= score <= 100: 'A'
80 <= score < 90: 'B'
70 <= score < 80: 'C'
60 <= score < 70: 'D'
0 <= score < 60: 'F'

Test Cases (given):

getGrade(95, 90, 93);    // "A"
getGrade(50, 50, 95);    // "D"

Pseudocode:

START

1.  GET mean
2.  GET letter grade
3.  PRINT result

END
