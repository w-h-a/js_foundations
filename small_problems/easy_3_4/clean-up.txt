Problem:

Function takes string as input
Removes non-alphabetic characters and replaces them with space
but no consecutive spaces are allowed
Return the resulting string.

Test Cases (given):

cleanUp("---what's my +*& line?");    // " what s my line "

Pseudocode:

START

1.  SET alphabet array
2.  SET string array to split string
3.  WHILE alphabet does not include character in string array
      SET place space in string array instead
4.  WHILE string array array has consecutive spaces
      REDUCE string array
5.  RETURN joined string array

END
