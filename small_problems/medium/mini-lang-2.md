Problem:

A stack is a list of values that grows and shrinks. A stack might be implemented as an array that uses .push() and .pop().Â 

A stack-and-register programming language is a language that uses a stack of values. Each operation in the language operates on a register, which can be considered the current value. The register is not part of the stack. An operation that requires two values pops the topmost item from the stack, operates on the popped value and the register value, and stores the result back in the register.

This might sound complex, but the behavior is straightforward. Consider an OR operation in a stack-and-register language. It removes the topmost value from the stack, determines whether either the stack value or the register value is true, and stores the result back in the register. For example, if we start with a stack [3, true, 0 (where 0 is the topmost element in the stack) and a register value of [], the OR operation selects the 0 from the stack, and the result of the operation, true (after Boolean coercion), is left in the register. If we do another OR at this point, the true is selected from the stack, and the register is left with the value of true.

Consider an ID operation in the language. It removes the topmost value from the stack, determines whether the stack value and the register value are identical, and stores the result back in the register. For example, if we start with a stack [3, true, [3]] and register value of [3], the ID operation selects the [3] from the stack, and the result of the operation, false, is left in the register. If we do another ID at this point, the true is selected from the stack, and the register is left with the value of false. Finally, consider an EVERY-ID operation in the language. It determines whether each stack value and the register value are identical, and stores the result back in the register. For example, if we start with a stack [3, '3', [3]] and register value of [3], the result of the EVERY-ID operation, false, is left in the register.

The function implements a miniature stack-and-register-based programming language that has the following command (or operations):

x: place any JS value, x, in the register. Does not modify the stack.

PUSH: Push the register value onto the stack. The value is also still in the register.
POP: Remove the topmost item from the stack and place it in the register.
PRINT: Print the boolean version of register value
NOT: !Boolean(register value)

AND: Pop a value off of the stack and check conjunction of Boolean(value) and Boolean(register), storing result in register.
OR: Pop a value off of the stack and check disjunction of Boolean(value) and Boolean(register), storing result in register
CON: Pop a value off of the stack and check disjunction of !Boolean(value) and Boolean(register), storing result in register
BCON: Pop a value off of the stack and check Boolean(value) ? Boolean(register) : !Boolean(register)

ID: Pop a value off of the stack and check value === register, storing result in register
TRU: Pop a value off of the stack and check Boolean(value) === true, storing result in register
OBJECT-EXISTS: Pop a value off of the stack and check whether it is an object with properties, storing result in register

Programs will be supplied to the language function via a string argument. Each of the above operations is self-contained (i.e., operations are not operands of one another) and the syntax of the string argument is that each operation is separated by one whitespace.

Initialize the stack and register to the values [] and 0, respectively.Â 

- input: string
- output: boolean if, and only if, 'PRINT' is part of the input string

- explicit
  - operations are defined above
  - each operation is self-contained and the syntax of the string argument that each operation is separated by one whitespace
  - initialize the stack and register to [] and 0, respectively

- implicit
  - working with stack with length 0 is permissible
