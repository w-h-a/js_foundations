In the modern era under the Gregorian Calendar, leap years occur every year that is evenly divisible by 4, unless the year is also divisible by 100. If the year is evenly divisible by 100, it is not a leap year unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400.

Assume this rule is valid for every year greater than year 0. 

Write a function that takes any year greater than 0 as input and returns true if it is a leap year, false otherwise. 

The British Empire adopted the Gregorian Calendar in 1752, which was a leap year. Before 1752, they used the Julian Calendar. Under the Julian Calendar, leap years occur in any year that is evenly divisible by 4. 

Using this information, update the previous function so that it either takes this historical information into account or not. That is, if it does, leap years before 1752 are determined differently.
