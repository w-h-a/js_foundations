Problem:

Write a program that asks for the user's name.
The computer yells back a greeting if the user follows their
input with an exclamation mark or writes in all caps; otherwise,
the computer greets without yelling.


Test Cases (given):

What is your name?Â 
Bob
Hello Bob.

What is your name?
Bob!
HELLO BOB. WHY ARE WE SCREAMING?

High-Level Program:

1. Asks user for their name. Assign the value to a variable called 'userName'.
2. Suppose userName is all caps or followed by exclamation mark.
    1. Declare actualName and assign it the value of userName.
    2. If userName ends with an exclamation mark, then assign actualName
        the contents of userName without the exclamation mark.
    3. Computer snaps back.
3. Suppose userName is neither all caps nor followed by exclamation mark.
    Then computer greets normally.
