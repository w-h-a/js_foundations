Problem:

Create a function that takes two strings as arguments,
determines the length of the two strings, and
return the result of concatenating the shorter, the longer, and the shorter once again.
You may assume the strings are of different lengths.

Test Cases (Given):

shortLongShort('abc', 'defgh');    // "abcdefghabc"
shortLongShort('abcde', 'fgh');    // "fghabcdefgh"
shortLongShort('', 'xyz');         // "xyz"

High-Level Program:

1. Declare length variables (length1 and length2) and
assign to them the lengths of the strings.
2. If length1 > length2, then return secondString + firstString + secondString
3: If length2 > length1, then return firstString + secondString + firstString
