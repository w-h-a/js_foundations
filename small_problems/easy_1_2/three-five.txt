Problem:

Create a function that iteratively creates an array of multiples of
3 or 5 up to and including a given target and, furthermore,
returns the sum of the multiples.

Test Cases (given):

Input: 20
Output: 98

Input: 3
Output: 3

Input: 5
Output: 8

Input: 10
Output: 33

Input: 1000
Output: 234168

High-Level Program:

1. Create an empty array called ‘multiples’ that will contain the multiples.
2. Declare an iteration variable and set it to 1.
3. While the iteration variable is less than the target
    1. For each factor, append the current iteration value to multiples
        if the value isn’t already in multiples and
        the value is divisible by the factor without remainder.
    2. Add 1 to the iteration variable.
4. Compute and return the sum of the numbers in multiples.
