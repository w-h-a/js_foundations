Problem:

The program takes bill amount and tip percentage as input and outputs
the tip amount and the tip amount plus the bill amount (i.e., the total).

Test Cases:

Input:
  bill: 200
  percentage: 15
Output:
  tip: $30.00
  total: $230.00

Input:
  bill: 200
  percentage: 0.15
Output:
  tip: $30.00 (if it's a decimal, assume it should be 15 percent and not 0.15 percent)
  total: $230.00

High-Level Program

1. Asks user for bill amount.
2. Asks user for percentage.
3. Gets tip:
    1. If the percentage input is an integer, then tip = bill amount * (percentage / 100)
    2. If the percentage input is a decimal, then tip = bill amount * percentage
4. Get total: tip + bill amount.
5. Return tip and total.
