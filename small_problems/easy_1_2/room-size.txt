ORIGINAL EXERCISE
Problem:

The program should take length and width in meters and output
square meters and square feet.

1 square meter == 10.7639 square feet

Input: string (meters)
Output:
  square meters: string (from a number, round to 2 decimals)
  square feet: string (from a number, round to 2 decimals)

Test Case:

7 * 10 = 70
70 * 10.7639 = 753.47

High-Level Program:

Input data type: string
Output data type: string

1. Asks user for length of their room in meters (converts to number)
2. Asks user for width of their room in meters (converts to number)
3. Gets square meters and square feet, returns numbers and rounds.

FURTHER EXPLORATION
Problem:
Same as the above, but ask the user if they are using meters or feet.

1 square meter == 10.7639 square feet

Input:
  unit: string
  length: string
  width: string
Output:
  square meters: string (from a number, round to 2 decimals)
  square feet: string (from a number, round to 2 decimals)

Test Cases:

Input:
  unit: meters
  length: 7
  width: 10
Output: Same as above

Input:
  unit: feet
  length: 7
  width: 10
Output: The area is 70 square feet (or == 6.50 square meters)

High-Level Program:

1. Asks user for unit of measurement (meters or feet)
2. Asks user for length of their room (converts to number)
3. Asks user for width of their room (converts to number)
4. Gets square meters and square feet, returns numbers and rounds.
