Problem:

Write a program that asks the user whether they want to take into account
the fact that the British Empire used the Julian Calendar before 1752.

If not, then the the Gregorian Calendar method of determining leap years
should be used for all years greater than 0. In that case,
if either (i) the year is
  (a) cleanly divisible by 4, and
  (b) not cleanly divisible by 100, or
(ii) the year is cleanly divisible by 400, then
the year is a leap year; otherwise, not.

If, on the other hand, the user does wish to take that historical fact into account,
then we have the following split method.
If the year is from and including 1752 forward, whether the year is a leap year
should be determined using the above method.
If the year is after 0 and up to 1751, whether the year is a leap year should
be determined by the following method:
The year is a leap year if, and only if, the year is cleanly divisible by 4.

Either way, the program should return true if the input year is a leap year,
false otherwise.

Test Cases (given):

isLeapYear(2016);      // true CHECK
isLeapYear(2015);      // false CHECK
isLeapYear(2100);      // false CHECK
isLeapYear(2400);      // true CHECK
isLeapYear(240000);    // true CHECK
isLeapYear(240001);    // false CHECK
isLeapYear(2000);      // true CHECK
isLeapYear(1900);      // false CHECK
isLeapYear(1752);      // true CHECK
isLeapYear(1700);      // if Greg, false; if Julian, true CHECK
isLeapYear(1);         // if Greg, false; if Julian, false CHECK
isLeapYear(100);       // if Greg, false; if Julian, true CHECK
isLeapYear(400);       // if Greg, true; if Julian, true CHECK

High-Level Program:

1. Asks user whether they want to take into account the fact that the
British Empire used the Julian Calendar before 1752.
2. Asks user for year greater than 0.
3. If non-Julian, then jump to 5.
4. If Julian/Gregorian mix and year is greater than or equal to 1752, jump to 6;
otherwise, jump to 5.
5. Determine whether we have a leap year or not. (Gregorian)
    if either
    (i) the year is
        (a) cleanly divisibly by 4, and
        (b) not cleanly divisibly by 100, or
    (ii) the year is cleanly divisible by 400, then leap year, otherwise not.
    Return true or false, depending on result.
6. Determine whether we have a leap year or not. (Julian)
    The year is a leap year if, and only if, the year is cleanly divisible by 4.
    Return true or false, depending on result.
