Problem:

Create a function that takes 2 arguments: an array, and an object.
The array will contain 2 or more elements that, when combined with adjoining spaces,
will produce a person's name.
The object contains two key-value pairs.
The function should return a greeting that uses the person's full name, and
mentions the person's title and occupation.

Test Cases (given):

console.log(greetings(["John", "Q", "Doe"], {title: "Master", occupation: "Plumber"}));

// should log: 'Hello, John Q Doe! Nice to have a Master Plumber around.'

(Not so) High-Level Program:

1. From arrayParam, create a string where each element in the array is separated
    by a space. Call this 'createdString'.
2. Return `Hello, ${createdString}! Nice to have a ${objectParam['title']} ${objectParam['occupation']} around.`
