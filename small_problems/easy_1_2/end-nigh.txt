ORIGINAL EXERCISE
Problem:

Write a function. The function should return the penultimate word in a string.
You may assume that the string contains at least two words.

Test Cases (given):

console.log(penultimate("last word") === "last"); // logs true
console.log(penultimate("Launch School is great!") === "is"); // logs true

High-Level Program:

1. The function splits the string into an array of words.
2. The function returns the penultimate word.

FURTHER EXPLORATION
Problem:

Write a function. The function should return the middle word in a string.

Test Cases:

Input: 'hello ole chap'
Output: 'ole'

Input: 'hello little sunshine ray'
Output: 'little', 'sunshine'

Input: 'hello'
Output: 'hello'

Input: ''
Output: I am error.

Input: Hello   how       are     you    doing.
Output: are

Input: I    am   at      the crazy        house.
Output: at, the

High-Level Program:

1. Asks user for string of words.
2. If string is empty after trimming off white space, return error message and stop.
3. Splits the string into an array of words.
4. Removes all whitespace elements from the array of words.
5. Suppose length of array is odd.
    1. Divide length by 2 and round up. Call this 'result'.
    2. Return word at index result minus 1.
6. Suppose length is even.
    1. Divide length by 2. Call this 'result'.
    2. Return words: one at index result minus 1 and one at index result.
