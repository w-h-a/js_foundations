Problem:

Function takes two arrays as arguments and
returns an array containing the union of the values from the two.

There should be no duplication of values in the returned array,
even if duplicates are in the original array.

You may assume that both arguments are always arrays.

Test Cases (Given):

union([1, 3, 5], [3, 6, 9]);    // [1, 3, 5, 6, 9]

Pseudocode:

Unlike many of the "easy" problems, this one was actually easy enough
that I decided to skip the pseudocode.
