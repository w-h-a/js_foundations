Problem:

Function that combines two arrays passed as arguments and
returns a new array that contains all elements from both array arguments,
with each element taken in alternation.

You may assume that both arrays are non-empty and
that they have the same number of elements.

Test Cases (Given):

interleave([1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']);    // [1, "a", 2, "b", 3, "c"]

Pseudocode:

START

1.  SET result array to empty array
2.  WHILE there are still elements to add to result array
      SET result array to include ith element of each input array
      SET idx variable to idx plus 1
3.  RETURN/PRINT result array

END
