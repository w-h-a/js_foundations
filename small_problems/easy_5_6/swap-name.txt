Problem:

Function takes a string argument consisting of
a first name, space, and a last name
and returns a new string consisting of
the last name, a comma, space, and the first name.

Test Cases (given):

swapName('Joe Roberts');    // "Roberts, Joe"

Pseudocode:

START

1.  SET arrayRep to string that is split at the space
2.  SET 1st element of arrayRep to include comma after
3.  PRINT 1st element of arrayRep plus space plus 0th element of arrayRep

END
