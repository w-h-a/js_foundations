Problem:

Create a function that takes two integers as arguments.
The first argument is a count, and
the second is the starting number of a sequence that your function will create.

The function should return an array containing
the same number of elements as the count argument.
The value of each element should be a multiple of the starting number.

If the count is 0, the function should return an empty array.

Test Cases (Given):

sequence(5, 1);          // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sequence(4, -7);         // [-7, -14, -21, -28]
sequence(3, 0);          // [0, 0, 0]
sequence(0, 1000000);    // []

Pseudocode:

START

1.  SET array to length of count
2.  SET array to include undefined in each element
3.  WHILE there are (undefined) elements
      SET element to number * (1 + idx)
4.  RETURN array

END
