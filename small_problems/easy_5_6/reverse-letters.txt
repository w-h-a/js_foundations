Problem:

Function takes a string argument containing one or more words and
returns a new string containing the words from the string argument.

If the word length >= 5,
the letters should be presented in reverse order;
otherwise, the word should be presented as-is.

You may assume that the string argument will consist of only letters and spaces.
You may assume that a single space separates words.

Test Cases (given):

reverseWords('Professional');             // "lanoisseforP"
reverseWords('Walk around the block');    // "Walk dnuora the kcolb"
reverseWords('Launch School');            // "hcnuaL loohcS"

Pseudocode:

START

1.  SET array to string split by spaces
2.  SET reducedArray to empty array
3.  WHILE array has elements
      SET nested to string split
      IF length of nested >= 5
        SET reducedArray to include reversed and joined nested
      ELSE
        SET reducedArray to include joined nested
4.  RETURN joined reducedArray

END
