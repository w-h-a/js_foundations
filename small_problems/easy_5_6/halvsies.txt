Problem:

Function takes an array as an argument and
returns an array that contains two elements,
each of which is an array.

Put the first half of the original array elements in the first element, and
put the second half in the second element.

If the original array contains an odd number of elements,
place the middle element in the first half array.

Test Cases (Given):

halvsies([1, 2, 3, 4]);       // [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
halvsies([1, 5, 2, 4, 3]);    // [[1, 5, 2], [4, 3]]
halvsies([5]);                // [[5], []]
halvsies([]);                 // [[], []]

Pseudocode:

START

1.  SET arrayOArrays to empty array;
2.  GET firstHalf
      WHILE the length of the firstHalf is less than input array
        PUSH shifted element from input array to firstHalf
3.  SET arrayOArrays to array1 as one element and input array as the other
4.  PRINT arrayOArrays

END
